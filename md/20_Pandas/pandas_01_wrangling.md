# Pandas and Wrangling

A Pandas dataframe is essentially a matrix with headers and a unique index.
My most common use case is to create a Pandas dataframe from a csv file.

Look up here, if you want a hint on, for instance,
- How do I create a Pandas dataframe from lists?
- How do I change a column in a Pandas dataframe on condition?
- How do I insert a row in a Pandas datafram?

## Getting to Pandas Dataframes

Wrangling starts with creating a dataframe. 

The most common options might be 
- Create a dataframe from a Python list or dictionary
- Create a dataframe when reading data from a local filesystem
- Create a dataframe when downloading data from the internet

You might also want to save, delete, ... a dataframe.

For the details, see [Listing on Create Pandas Dataframes](listing_pandas)


## Working on a Pandas dataframe

Once you have got your dataframe, you might want to 
- Work on the complete dataframe
- Work on columns
- Work on rows

For the details, see [Listing on Operate on Pandas Dataframes](listing_pandas_operate)

For preparing the visualization, some Pandas operations are typically needed. These operations are however not different from those listed above.
