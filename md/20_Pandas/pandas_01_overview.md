## Getting to Pandas Dataframes

First of all, you need dataframes.

Options include:
- Create a dataframe yourself
- Create a dataframe from a file
- Download data from the internet to a dataframe

Once you have one or several dataframes, you might want to
- work only on a subset of the original dataframe
- merge different dataframe to a new one

Finally, you probably want to save dataframes locally.

For the details, see [Listing on Create Pandas Dataframes](listing_pandas)


## Working on a particular Pandas Dataframe

Let's distinguish the following options:
- Working on the complete dataframe
- Working on columns
- Working on rows

For the details, see [Listing on Operate on Pandas Dataframes](listing_pandas_operate)
