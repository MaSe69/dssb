## [Getting Started](python_gettingStarted)

- Before starting with dataframes
- Comparison Python to Julia

## [Create dataframes](pandas_create)

## [Download + Save](pandas_download)

- Download with a url into a dataframe
- Save the dataframe locally

You should now have sufficient own or other dataframes at your disposition.
