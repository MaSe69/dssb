# Visualizations

# Matplotlib

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is the standard library for Pandas dataframe visualization.

The [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/api/pyplot_api.html) - API give programatically access from a Python program to the rich functionality of Matplotlib.

>
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Moveover, Pandas integrates Matplotlib such that the plot functionality can be directly called as a method of the dataframe.

>
    df.plot()


# Seaborn

[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. 



# Vegalite

(Vegalite)[https://vega.github.io/) is a visualization library independent of Matplotlib and not necessarily the natural option to be used with Python. However, there are libraries to enable the use of Vegalite from Pandas. 


# Gadfly.jl

[Gadfly.jl](http://gadflyjl.org/stable/) is a system for plotting and visualization written in Julia.
Apparantly, there is not readily available library to use it from Python.
