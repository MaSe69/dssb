# Altair Stories

Starting from the fundamental 'Vega cars' example, Altair configurations are added.

## List of Examples

- Most common configurations are applied in [Example - Vega Cars - Expanded](vega_cars)
- Configurations are efficiently developed and stored in a theme [Example - Vega Cars - Theme](vega_cars_theme)
- First interactive elements are applied in [Example - Vega Cars - Interactive](vega_cars_interactive)
- Adoptions for time series are made in [Example - Time series](timeseries)



### Time series


As well known, Pandas comes with great support for time series. Altair adds great support for the x-axis. In particular, the tick labels are set in a meaningful manner. Adding, for instance, the year at the position of January on a multi-year x-axis is a little, but great feature.
