# Python vs. Julia 

Just a little 'reminder' table

|  What do you want to do?   | Python | Julia |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Print to console | print | println |
| Mark as text | " or ' | " only |
| Print value of variable v | print("Text ", v)  | print("Text $v)
| Concatenate 2 strings | operator: + | operator: * |
| Slice string or array | str[1:] | str[2:end] |
| Start counting | with 0 | with 1 |
| Convert float to int | int(f) | convert(Int64, f)|
| Get type of variable | type | typeof |


Remember: 

- Python needs indent, Julia needs an 'end'
