# Python vs. Julia 

Just a little 'reminder' table

| What do you want to do? | Python | Julia |
| Start counting | with 0 | with 1 |
| Mark as Text | " or ' | " only |
| print to console | print | println |
| print value of variable v | print("Text ", v)  | print("Text $v)
| Slice string or array | str[1:] | str[1:end] |
| Convert float to int | int(f) | convert(Int64, f)|
| Concatenate 2 strings | operator: + | operator: * |
| Get type of variable | type | typeof |
| 

Remember: 

- Python needs indent, Julia needs an 'end'
