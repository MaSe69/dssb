# Julia Conference 2021

I registered for the annual conference on the programming language Julia, [juliacon2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/), which took place end of July.
The conference was virtual implying recorded videos instantly available. 

Julia is a newer alternative to Python and R in the area of Data Science. One of Julia's advantages, in my opinion, is a lively community focused on Data Science problems. 
The potential of Julia is not only to close gaps to the older programming languages, but to offer standalone functionality.

## Julia Usage

For getting an overview on Julia usage, I was anxious to see the results of the [survey on Julia usage](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/WDFZWG) in which I had participated. 
The choice seems to be really between Python and Julia. C-based languages being also an alternative. R and Matlab might be the alternative for Data Science problems. 

Topics that I am interested in rank in the top usages of Julia: Data Science (on top position), Statistics, Machine Learning, Visualization. 

I switched in the last months frequently between Jupyter and VSCode. Surprisingly, VSCode together with the Julia Extension has taken a big leap as the most popular development environment.
There is also now the possibility to [use Jupyter notebooks to VSCode](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/AUYF3X). 

Plots.jl and DataFrames.jl are the two most popular Julia packages.

## DataFrames

As I spent most of my time with dataframes, I was looking forward to the contributions by the main expert in this field. 
Bogumił Kamiński gave a 3 hours [tutorial on dataframes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJf24gfcSto).
He also gave a 15 minutes update on the [current state of Dataframes](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/VSMCQG).

## Various Talks of My Interest

These are just the ones that overlap with my genuine interests, there were surely other great talks.

### Dictionaries

I liked the new [Dictionary.jl](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/WRNAEN), which confirmed my opinion that the original Julia syntax for dictionaries is quite cumbersome. 
I tried it out immediately. Unfortunately, I did not succeed to create a dataframe from dictionary created in this new way. 

### Kubernetes
Kolia Sadeghi showed how to make yourself comfortable with [Julia in Kubernetes](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/9LCKEQ).

### Performance 
Last but not least the talk on the [State of Julia](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/UJUE8P) should be mentioned. It was pointed out, for instance, the great performance of Dataframes.jl.
It is reassuring for my application purposes to hear that 100 million rows are considered to be only a "moderate amount of data". 

## Conclusion 

JuliaCon 2021 confirmed my impression that much progress to support Data Science has been made.
