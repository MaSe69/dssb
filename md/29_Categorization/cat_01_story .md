# Categorization Story

In this story on categorization, you get some details on how to apply Pandas and Altair to discrete problems.


## List of Examples


### K-Means



### Decision Tree

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.



### Random Forest



The examples worked out for the 'Time Series Story' include

- Fundamental time series - making use of Pandas and Altair, see [Time Series - Starter](time_series_starter)
- Rolling updates to time series, see [Time Series - Updates](time_series_updates)
- Fit a linear regression to model data and check with test data, see [Time Series - Linear Regression](time_series_regression)
- Fit a Logistics regression to model data and check with test data, see [Time Series - Logistics Regression](time_series_logistics)
