### Random Forest



The examples worked out for the 'Time Series Story' include

- Fundamental time series - making use of Pandas and Altair, see [Time Series - Starter](time_series_starter)
- Rolling updates to time series, see [Time Series - Updates](time_series_updates)
- Fit a linear regression to model data and check with test data, see [Time Series - Linear Regression](time_series_regression)
- Fit a Logistics regression to model data and check with test data, see [Time Series - Logistics Regression](time_series_logistics)
