# Categorization Data Set

The data set presented here is used in the categorization models.

Some thoughts on it:
- Data privacy is an important topic in data science. The problem becomes more visible when names are introduced.
- The attributes and the target values shall be 'neutral'. 
- The data shall start simple, but be expanded into non-trivial complexity.

The concrete scenario:
- An offer is made to a number of employees.
- An employee can accept this offer or not.
- The offer here shall be 'a week of training'. So, the employee can either work as normal or to travel to another place to learn some new skills.

The task for a data scientist is to support the organization team for such a training set-up on questions like:
- How many training seats need to be offered?
- On which attributes does the acceptance of such a training depend?
- Would different types of training lead to more acceptance?
