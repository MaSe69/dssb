# Fundamentals

What was needed to complete the stories above should be described here.<br>
Though it might look like a lot, it's only a tiny fraction of what is available.<br>
If you don't find here, what you are looking for, you might want to deep dive here: [References on Python Dataframes](python_references) 


### Python (Plain)

Some plain [Python](python_overview)  is definitely needed, for instance to work with
- Arrays, Dictionaries, Comprehensions
- Flow logic
- Files


### Python Dataframes - Pandas

First, you need to [get your dataframes](listing_pandas). There are several methods described.

Then, you might want to [work on dataframes](listing_pandas_operate). This is a deep topic.<br>

The content here on working with dataframes is grouped into 3 categories.<br>

- Dataframes: ..., slice, merge, ...
- Columns: Create new columns, Rename, Re-order, ... , Delete columns
- Rows: Create new rows, Filter, Select, Sort, ..., Delete rows

It is further grouped according to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)


##  Visualization of Dataframe in Python

The content of a dataframe is usually clear to the person who has worked for it. Often, this content needs to be presented which is mostly done using visualization.

Altair is a Python visualization that has a great interface to dataframes.<br> 
Altair enables interactive charts. Click on the chart below or on the following link to get to the [interactive version for multiple selection](vega_cars_multi_selection). 



You can get here a brief [Altair overview](altair_overview).<br>
You can find details directly in the [Altair listing](altair_listing).<br>

The content on visualization is grouped into 3 categories.<br>

- Charts: Types (Scatter, Line, Area, ...), Size, Titles, ...
- Axis: Labels, Ticks, Scaling, ...
- Interactivity: Tooltips, Selections, ...
