# Python

## Pandas

The library for dataframes in Python is Pandas.

The Python library Pandas had its initial release in 2008, [see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)). 

Parts of its history is described by its inventor 
[Wes McKinney | Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHdkFyGCxiY). Wes McKinney published a book on Pandas which remarkably is not named Pandas, but "Python for Data Analysis". 
The coding of this book is available on Gibhub:
-  [https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)

Wes McKinney was employed at that time at a financial department which might explain the good support of time series in Pandas. Pandas grew in an environment of Excel, Matplab and R.
