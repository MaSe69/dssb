# Python Overview

Some tasks must be completed before dataframes can be used. Sometimes, Python is needed to change the dataframe itself.

These are some tasks that you might want to consider:

### Primitives

- Working with Strings, Floats, Integers
- Conversions of primitives

### Structures and Conditions

- Create arrays and dictionaries
- Loop over arrays and dictionaries
- Convert arrays to dictionaries and vice versa.

### Comprehensions

- Find all elements in an array on condition

### Files

- Read, save or find files.


For details, see [Python Listing](python_listing).
