The inventor of Pandas, Wes McKinney, was employed at that time at a financial department which might explain the good support of time series in Pandas. Pandas grew in an environment of Excel, Matlab and R.  

Parts of the history of Pandas is described by its inventor

## Python Community and Resources

Stackoverflow has emerged as THE reference for Python and Pandas. This might not be noteworthy, if true for Julia dataframes. Julia dataframes can be found on stackoverflow, but rather rarely. The dataframe tag in stackoverflow is about hundred thousand questions, with predominantly Pandas dataframes being asked for.

You can find on Github complete solutions as Jupyter Lab.
Further deep and brilliantly worked out solutions to concrete problems in Pandas can be found on Kaggle.
