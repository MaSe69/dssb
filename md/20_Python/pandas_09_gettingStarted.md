## Before Python Installation

My recommendations:
- Setup a Linux Operation system, e.g. Ubuntu.
- For versioning, use Git.
- For installation, use apt-get or pip3.
- Use Visual Studio Code together with its Python Extension.

All you need, you find on the web. My apologies to not be able to give details on these prerequisites. Also, such details outdate quickly. 

Having said that, I put some links here [Python References](python_references). 


## Python Installation

Last update: June 2021

When you install Ubuntu, Python in version 3.8 or higher is already installed.


## Python - "Before Dataframe" 

Though the focus is on dataframes here, a very brief introduction should be provided on the topics between 'starting with Python' as a programming language and starting with dataframes in Python.

In fact, it might be easy to get lost on the way towards the dataframes. Here is what you might want to be aware of before starting with dataframes:

As a point on this site is to help to switch between Python and Julia smoothly, I put a summary of some relevant differences in the context here:
