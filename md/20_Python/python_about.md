# Python About

Let's start the Python journey with a console output like

>
    print("Hello World)

From there, we could replace the strings with variables, following the path of a typical tutorial.

A first hurdle might be to change a string, because strings are immutable.
I often need to convert "202101" to "2021-01". This is can be done using slicing in this way:

>
    myStringNew = myString[:4] + "-" + myString[4:6]
