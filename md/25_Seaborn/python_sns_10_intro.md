# Matplotlib + Seaborn

Several libraries can be used to visualize the content of a dataframe, see the [visualization library](visualization_python_references)

## Examples

The available plots are in practice dominated by 
- [Scatter Plot](scatter_plot)
- [Histogram Plot](hist_plot)
- [Bar Plot](bar_plot) (both horizontally and vertically)
- [Line Plot](line_plot)
- [Box Plot with Additional Strip Plot](box_plot)


## Beauty in Visualization

Certainly a beautiful dataframe should be visualized in a beautiful way.
The definition of beauty holds true here as well, i.e. beauty does not mean to use an exotic and colorful plot.

Visualization is in the service of insight.
The point to be made by a visualization should become as clear as possible. It must not be obscured or even falsified by any concept of beauty.

Aspect ratio is important. A 4:3 ratio is a good starting point, deviate only for good reason.

Surprises shall be pointed out, expected information should be softened.

Texts should be readable by persons with normal eyesight.

Colors should be limited to two to three.
There are extensive theories on fitting colors, and many designers who already applied them successfully.
At least, do not mix pale and bright colors, except for good reason.
