### About This Website

This website is first of all a private one.
There are no business or academic constraints. Hence, it can evolve 'freely'. 

Nevertheless, I do have ambitious goals.

First, it shall contain my best solutions for problems that I encountered myself.<br>
Often, I have found or worked out myself various solutions for the same problem. I re-visited these solutions and decided for a small subset. Be aware though that the chosen solution is the solution of my choice, it does not need to be the shortest, coolest or most memory efficient solution. There are plenty of other solutions out there.  <br>

**The collection of tried-out solutions here should cover an abundance of practical problems.**


Second, I want develop a true time saver by 
- optimizing for search. 
- being consistent in naming, wording, etc... .  
- ordering things 'bottom-up': From easy to difficult, from basic to complex.

**A solution should quick to find, to understand and to consume.** 


Third, - and admittedly - I do want to propagate my personal view on data science:
- Starting with great questions, an important domain can be modelled using (beautiful) dataframes.
- Mastering the skills to efficiently work on such dataframes is crucial in this process. 
- Visualizations, models are used to get to deeper insights or to decisions.

**The big picture should both outline and detail the way from data to insights.**



### Status

'Beautiful dataframes' went live in early summer 2021.
At that time, I tried for the second time to move from Python to Julia. 
Hence, I had to look at my Python code and find equivalent solutions in Julia.

For various reason, this migration failed and I continued to program in Python, but with many ideas taken from the Julia community.

When programs or websites grow, they eventually need a refactoring. <br>
Shouldn't a site on dataframe be using dataframes itself?
At least, it should be tried out.

In late 2021, the rework of the Python part is rather completed.
The listing on [how to operate on a Pandas Dataframe](listing_pandas_operate) took me a long time.
It seems that there is always at least the idea of an even better solution once you think that you found the final one.

Next on the backlog is a rework of the Altair part, which lags behind in describing my current solutions.

The site usage shows the interest in Julia topics. Hopefully, time permits to re-work the Julia part soon. 

I always keep improving the [references](python_references) to point out to the many great original contributions. The importance of Pandas can never be over-emphasized!
