# Beautiful Dataframes

Dataframes are great.<br>
Beautiful dataframes are even better, because they lead to many more insights!<br><br>
A beautiful dataframe is a technical dataframe containing specific data and shaped to perfection.

### About this site

You can find here an approach to 'think in dataframes', 
but you are welcome to just use it as an info source.

- For free, you find on this site plenty of knowledge for immediate benefit to your dataframes, like this [Pandas Cheat Sheet](Pandas_Cheat_Sheet)
- Technical documentation is mostly available [in many references](references), but scarce are resources to combine the pieces.
- New insights emerging from in real life projects are constantly added. 

## Focus on dataframes

The approach taken here is to focus on a dataframes as entity in its own right. 

Most approaches in data science seem to focus on the model. Models are fine, but they are here only seens as tools to describe the dataframe. 

### Comparisons

Reportedly, a sculptor said: "The lion was inside the stone all the time. I just had to remove everything that did not look like it."
Similarly, the beautiful dataframe is in the data. All you have to do is to put the data into a dataframe and then operate on it until it becomes that beautiful dataframe.

When seeing a child drawing a few lines and dots on a paper, you might ask: "What is it?". The child might be buffled, because the image seems to be so clear. Similarly, an experienced data scientists 'sees' structures in raw data. The difficulty is to make this structure visible to any interested person. Visualization in this sense is just a tool to point out clearly features of the dataframe.  

### Benefits of dataframe focused approach

- Focusing on dataframes, you can reach goals that might have looked out of scope for you so far.
- Shaping a dataframes can help you to look at familiar problems from new angles, and to come to surprising insights.
- Good skills in Dataframes make you more flexible when switching between most popular languages in data science: Python, Julia, R and more. 

### Programming languages

The choice of programming language does matter.  
Apparantely, there is a mutual understanding in the programming community about 'what is a dataframe and what is not'. 




## What is beauty here?

Beauty can be defined as the 'place to be'
Beauty comprises fundamental elements and their relationships to each others. 

There are other dimensions of importance, such as
- Being in control
- Simplicity

# Dataframes

First, let's cover the fundamental skill sets

- You can [create dataframes](pandas_createDF) yourself
- Can load existing data directly into a dataframe
- Operations on columns
- Operations on rows
- Working on subsets of a dataframe
- Merging with other dataframes

# Beautiful dataframes

- Authenticty (Identity)
- Consistency (Symmetry)
